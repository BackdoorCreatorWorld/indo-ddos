What is DDoS?

DDoS stands for Distributed Denial of Service.
It is a cyberattack where multiple devices send a large amount of traffic to a server, website, or network at the same time, causing it to slow down or crash so normal users cannot access it.

don't use this DDOS at heavy server/web, its cause you get arrest for cyber criminal
we are not responsible if you got for cyber crime, because we create this for testing CyberSecurity
remember use this DDos for LEARNING
